### Hi there 👋

This is RecuencoJones and I love solving problems :smile:

👨‍💻 I do:
- JavaScript & TypeScript all around with a heavy preference for frontend development.
- Vue 💚 and React ⚛️
- NestJS 😻
- More often than not participate in DevOps activities. Which translates into groovyish, bashy or pythony stuff.

🌱 Currently learning:
- Golang
- Rust (not too good at it tho)


⚡ Fun fact: 

My father used to be known as "Recuenco Jones" because of his lastname Recuenco and Jones because he loved Indiana Jones movies. However, in spanish it can be read as Recuen Cojones where "cojones" is a spanish word meaning "balls" :joy:
